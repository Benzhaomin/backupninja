WARNING FOR DUPLICITY USERS

1. Old (pre-0.9.4) example.dup file used to give false information about the way
   the GnuPG-related options are used. Please read the new example.dup file, and
   update your own configuration files if needed.

2. The bandwidthlimit option does not work anymore with duplicity >=0.4.2.
   Trying to solve this...
