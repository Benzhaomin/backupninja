. Make ninjahelper allow you to pick what type of backup you want (instead
  of just assuming you want local-to-remote, or push backups. Some people
  want local-to-local, or remote-to-local, or pull backups). This has been
  reported for the duplicity handler as Debian bug #346040.

. Make it so backupninja can be run as a regular user, instead of requiring
  root

. Implement the vsnames options in the mysql, svn and sys handlers, the same
  way as it already works in the duplicity and rdiff handlers. Then edit the
  corresponding helpers to make them use the lib/vserver functions to support
  this option.

. Factorize the rdiff.helper's connection-related functions into a lib, so
  that they can be used by dup.helper too. (NB: don't forget that the dup
  handler has a sshoptions configuration setting, that is often used to
  specify an alternative SSH key, or a specific IP to bind to.)
